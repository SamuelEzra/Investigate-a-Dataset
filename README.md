# Investigate-a-Dataset
Project: Life Expectancy Data Analysis

Introduction
It is a fact that life expectancy differs from one part of the world to another. In this project, factors that tend to affect life expectancy will be investigated as well as countries that have performed best and least between 2000 and 2017. The datasets chosen for this project was gotten from Gapminder World. Six datasets were selected for this analysis. These include data on: life expectancy, male life expectancy, basic sanitation, estimated income per person, employment rate, and urban population. Data for some matrics are not available for certain years. Hence, the assessment will be for a 17-year period, begining from the year 2000.

Questions like the following will be answered: Which country improved most in life expectancy during the past 17 years and by what margin? Which country declined the most in life expectancy and by what margin? What factors are associated with life expectancy? How do men compare in the life expectancy matric?
